## Why prairie-specific intelligence matters

Market leadership in the Prairies is often driven less by “the best molecule” and more by:
- Winning a few **high-leverage windows** with the right channel coverage
- Maintaining **pricing discipline** and clear positioning
- A **registration and label strategy** that reduces friction at the farm level
- Inventory that is **pre-positioned** early enough for spring demand while managing winter constraints
